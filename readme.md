# Front End Application - A TO-DO app.
In this application you're asked to design and implement the following.
The application should be able to handle user login and user registration.
## Functional Requirement’s
### User Signup/Registration
1. Create a user signup form which intakes the user’s information such as name,
address, date of birth, phone number and username.
2. Only the phone number entered in the following format will be valid (i.e. 999-999-9090)
3. Date of birth can be inputted in any formats.
4. After successful entry and validation of this data the user should be created and
saved in the database. (For this purpose any in-memory database utilization will be accepted)
5. There should be a successful message shown to the user on the registration form
upon user creation.
6. If there are any errors they should be displayed closer to the related fields.
7. Any other errors should be displayed at top of the form or any other place you find
apt.
User Login
1. Allow user to sign in to the application by validating the user’s username and
password
2. Create your own password policy. Anything basic and extendable solution will be
preferred to validate the password.
Home Page
1. Upon successful login the user should be redirected to the homepage where he can
perform CRUD operations on the tasks.
a. The user should be able to create a task. Such created tasks should be
displayed in a list view to the users.
b. Every task should have small buttons to perform update and delete on
those respective tasks.
c. Every task should be easily identifiable as a different task. Consider color
coding.
2. Every task will have the following details: name, description, status and dateTime at
which the task was created.
3. Status of the task could be created, in progress, completed.
4. The home page will also have header and footer area.
5. Header area will have a search bar to be able to search the tasks.
6. Provide an easy way to filter/sort the tasks based on date added and their statuses.
Branding feature. ( Theme Management )
The application’s UI color coding should be easily configured. Consider a use case
where this platform could be distributed to different
vendors and they have the option to apply their own color coding to this application.
Codebase Design Requirements
We are looking for clean organization of code. We would be looking at what design
choices are made, how is the folder structure organized for files such as css, html, js, jsx etc.
If using React, greater emphasis on reusable components, higher order functions will
be given.
Deployment/Hosting
Please provide an explanation as to how you choose to deploy this web application and

Make it available to use. What strategies you would choose ?
## Notes ::
1. Use of any 3rd party packages, libraries is permitted. Ideally such libraries should be
stable, reliable, simple to integrate and smaller in size.
2. Feel free to use any technologies you choose, but React will be preferred choice.
Submission
* Please provide a link to the app if you host it. (Optional)
* Upload it on Github and provide us a link.
* Also, provide estimation before starting the test.
